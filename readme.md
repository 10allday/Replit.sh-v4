# Replit.sh v4

This is the URL shortener for replit. Simply import it into Replit, make a secret called `IDS` and put a JSON array of your allowed JSON IDs inside. For example, if I wanted user IDs 12, 123, and 1234, I my secret would look like `[12,123,1234]`. If you need to find someone's user id, just have them go to https://replit-auth.ritza.repl.co/ and relay back their user ID.
